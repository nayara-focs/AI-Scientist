#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Comparative Optimization Grokking: Investigating the impact of SGD, Adam, and RMSprop on grokking in overparametrized neural networks.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: Compare the effects of SGD, Adam, and RMSprop on the grokking phenomenon in neural networks trained on small algorithmically generated datasets. Analyze how different optimization algorithms influence generalization performance, speed of learning, and the occurrence of grokking..  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'x_div_y': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.018480150727555156, 'final_val_loss_mean': 0.02484893426299095, 'final_train_acc_mean': 1.0, 'final_val_acc_mean': 0.9998779296875, 'step_val_acc_99_mean': 4080.0}, 'x_minus_y': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.0059833748964592814, 'final_val_loss_mean': 0.023401675280183554, 'final_train_acc_mean': 1.0, 'final_val_acc_mean': 1.0, 'step_val_acc_99_mean': 4515.0}, 'x_plus_y': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.0031202899990603328, 'final_val_loss_mean': 0.0034879110753536224, 'final_train_acc_mean': 1.0, 'final_val_acc_mean': 1.0, 'step_val_acc_99_mean': 2410.0}, 'permutation': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.15331691037863493, 'final_val_loss_mean': 7.519349098205566, 'final_train_acc_mean': 0.969531238079071, 'final_val_acc_mean': 0.013427734375, 'step_val_acc_99_mean': 5000.0}}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

For the experiment, we will focus on comparing the effects of SGD, Adam, and RMSprop on the grokking phenomenon in neural networks trained on small algorithmically generated datasets. We will analyze how different optimization algorithms influence generalization performance, speed of learning, and the occurrence of grokking.

Here is the plan for the experiments:

1. **Experiment 1: SGD**
   - Optimizer: SGD
   - Learning Rate: 0.01
   - Batch Size: 512
   - Number of Layers: 2
   - Number of Heads: 4

2. **Experiment 2: Adam**
   - Optimizer: Adam
   - Learning Rate: 0.001
   - Batch Size: 512
   - Number of Layers: 2
   - Number of Heads: 4

3. **Experiment 3: RMSprop**
   - Optimizer: RMSprop
   - Learning Rate: 0.001
   - Batch Size: 512
   - Number of Layers: 2
   - Number of Heads: 4

We will run each experiment with the specified hyperparameters and evaluate the results.

Shall we proceed with implementing these experiments?
