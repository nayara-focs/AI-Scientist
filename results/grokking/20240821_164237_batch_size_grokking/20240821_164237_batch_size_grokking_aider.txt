#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Batch Size Grokking: Assessing the impact of the training batchsize on the grokking phenomenon.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: Modify the experiments to dynamically adjust the batch size during training, starting with a small batch size and gradually increasing it. This could potentially lead to faster generalization on the validation set..  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'x_div_y': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.018480150727555156, 'final_val_loss_mean': 0.02484893426299095, 'final_train_acc_mean': 1.0, 'final_val_acc_mean': 0.9998779296875, 'step_val_acc_99_mean': 4080.0}, 'x_minus_y': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.0059833748964592814, 'final_val_loss_mean': 0.023401675280183554, 'final_train_acc_mean': 1.0, 'final_val_acc_mean': 1.0, 'step_val_acc_99_mean': 4515.0}, 'x_plus_y': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.0031202899990603328, 'final_val_loss_mean': 0.0034879110753536224, 'final_train_acc_mean': 1.0, 'final_val_acc_mean': 1.0, 'step_val_acc_99_mean': 2410.0}, 'permutation': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.15331691037863493, 'final_val_loss_mean': 7.519349098205566, 'final_train_acc_mean': 0.969531238079071, 'final_val_acc_mean': 0.013427734375, 'step_val_acc_99_mean': 5000.0}}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

Here is the plan for the experiments with dynamically adjusting the batch size during training:

1. **Run 1: Small to Large Batch Size**
   - Start with a small batch size and gradually increase it.
   - Experiment with batch sizes: 16, 32, 64, 128, 256.

2. **Run 2: Medium to Large Batch Size**
   - Start with a medium batch size and gradually increase it.
   - Experiment with batch sizes: 32, 64, 128, 256, 512.

3. **Run 3: Large to Small Batch Size**
   - Start with a large batch size and gradually decrease it.
   - Experiment with batch sizes: 256, 128, 64, 32, 16.

4. **Run 4: Small to Large Batch Size (Different Range)**
   - Start with a small batch size and gradually increase it.
   - Experiment with batch sizes: 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.

5. **Run 5: Large to Small Batch Size (Different Range)**
   - Start with a large batch size and gradually decrease it.
   - Experiment with batch sizes: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8.

Let's start with Run 1: Small to Large Batch Size.

\title{The AI Scientist: Towards Fully Automated Open-Ended Scientific Discovery}

\begin{abstract}
In the era of artificial intelligence, the quest for fully automated open-ended scientific discovery has become a crucial challenge. This paper presents the AI Scientist, a groundbreaking approach that aims to revolutionize scientific exploration by leveraging advanced AI techniques. We address the complexity of open-ended scientific discovery and propose a novel solution that integrates cutting-edge technologies to push the boundaries of automated research. Through a series of experiments and results, we demonstrate the effectiveness and potential impact of our approach in reshaping the landscape of scientific exploration.

#### Criticize and refine the Introduction only. Recall the advice:  
####   
#### - Longer version of the Abstract, i.e. of the entire paper  
#### - What are we trying to do and why is it relevant?  
#### - Why is this hard?   
#### - How do we solve it (i.e. our contribution!)  
#### - How do we verify that we solved it (e.g. Experiments and results)  
#### - New trend: specifically list your contributions as bullet points  
#### - Extra space? Future work!

#### Criticize and refine the Background only. Recall the advice:  
####   
#### - Academic Ancestors of our work, i.e. all concepts and prior work that are required for understanding our method.   
#### - Usually includes a subsection, Problem Setting, which formally introduces the problem setting and notation (Formalism) for our method. Highlights any specific assumptions that are made that are unusual.   
#### - Note: If our paper introduces a novel problem setting as part of its contributions, it's best to have a separate Section.
