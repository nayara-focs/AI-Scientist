#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Exploring Model Complexity and Grokking: Analyzing the interplay of architecture depth and attention heads on generalization in neural networks.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: Extend the existing code to include Transformer models with varying layer depths and attention head configurations. Train these models on diverse mathematical operation datasets to observe how model complexity affects the grokking phenomenon. Evaluate the models on standard performance metrics and analyze the patterns of learning and generalization..  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'x_div_y': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.018480150727555156, 'final_val_loss_mean': 0.02484893426299095, 'final_train_acc_mean': 1.0, 'final_val_acc_mean': 0.9998779296875, 'step_val_acc_99_mean': 4080.0}, 'x_minus_y': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.0059833748964592814, 'final_val_loss_mean': 0.023401675280183554, 'final_train_acc_mean': 1.0, 'final_val_acc_mean': 1.0, 'step_val_acc_99_mean': 4515.0}, 'x_plus_y': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.0031202899990603328, 'final_val_loss_mean': 0.0034879110753536224, 'final_train_acc_mean': 1.0, 'final_val_acc_mean': 1.0, 'step_val_acc_99_mean': 2410.0}, 'permutation': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.15331691037863493, 'final_val_loss_mean': 7.519349098205566, 'final_train_acc_mean': 0.969531238079071, 'final_val_acc_mean': 0.013427734375, 'step_val_acc_99_mean': 5000.0}}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

I will plan the list of experiments to run with varying layer depths and attention head configurations for Transformer models on diverse mathematical operation datasets:

1. **Experiment 1:**
   - Transformer model with 3 layers and 2 attention heads.
   - Dataset: ModSumDataset with p=97.
   - Training fraction: 0.5, Batch size: 512.

2. **Experiment 2:**
   - Transformer model with 4 layers and 4 attention heads.
   - Dataset: ModSubtractDataset with p=97.
   - Training fraction: 0.5, Batch size: 512.

3. **Experiment 3:**
   - Transformer model with 2 layers and 4 attention heads.
   - Dataset: ModDivisonDataset with p=97.
   - Training fraction: 0.5, Batch size: 512.

4. **Experiment 4:**
   - Transformer model with 3 layers and 3 attention heads.
   - Dataset: PermutationGroup with k=5.
   - Training fraction: 0.5, Batch size: 512.

5. **Experiment 5:**
   - Transformer model with 4 layers and 2 attention heads.
   - Dataset: ModSumDataset with p=97.
   - Training fraction: 0.5, Batch size: 512.

Let's start with Experiment 1.
